A comprehensive server-side economy mod for Minecraft Fabric 1.20.1 that introduces a secure currency system with ATMs, player trading, and NPC integration support.

**THIS MOD IS HEAVILY INSPIRED BY THE ORIGIN REALMS ECONOMY SYSTEM. THE BASE CONCEPTS ARE NOT MY IDEA, HOWEVER I AM CODING AND CREATING ALL THE ASSESTS.**

I have very little coding knowledge so I am relying on ChatGPT a lot for the basic coding. I would be very open to collaberation, otherwise development will be slow.
